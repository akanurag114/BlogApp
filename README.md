# BlogApp
This is a blog using Python Django.
This blog will be a multi-user blog, so you can think of it more as Company Blog Page, rather than a personal blog.
This multi-user behaviour will be easily extendable to future projects!
You can create,edit, publish or can delete the post.
While typing when you highlight something the editor will give option 
to bold, italic, underline, linking some url, header2, header3 and blockquote.
